r# Faculty Page (Our Teachers) - Fix Applied

## Issue
The `/our-teachers` page (Faculty page) was showing a blank screen with console error:
```
OurTeachers.tsx:285 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')
```

## Root Cause
The page was trying to map over `department.teachers` array without checking if it exists. When data is loaded from localStorage (synced from Supabase), some departments might have undefined `teachers` arrays.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Safe Data Loading
Added error handling and validation when loading data from localStorage:
```typescript
const savedData = localStorage.getItem('royal-academy-teachers');
if (savedData) {
  try {
    const parsed = JSON.parse(savedData);
    // Ensure all departments have a teachers array
    const validDepartments = parsed.map((dept: any) => ({
      ...dept,
      teachers: dept.teachers || []
    }));
    setDepartments(validDepartments);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('[OurTeachers] Error loading teacher data:', error);
  }
}
```

### 2. Null-Safe Rendering
Added checks before mapping over arrays:
```typescript
{(!department.teachers || department.teachers.length === 0) ? (
  <div className="text-center py-12 text-muted-foreground">
    <Users className="h-12 w-12 mx-auto mb-4 opacity-50" />
    <p>No teachers in this department yet.</p>
  </div>
) : (
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8">
    {(department.teachers || []).map((teacher, teacherIndex) => (
      // Teacher card content
    ))}
  </div>
)}
```

### 3. Conditional Field Display
Only show specialties and achievements if they exist:
```typescript
{teacher.specialties && teacher.specialties.length > 0 && (
  <div className="mb-6">
    <h6 className="font-semibold mb-2 text-foreground">Specialties:</h6>
    // ... specialty badges
  </div>
)}

{teacher.achievements && teacher.achievements.length > 0 && (
  <div className="mb-6">
    <h6 className="font-semibold mb-2 text-foreground">Recent Achievements:</h6>
    // ... achievement list
  </div>
)}
```

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/OurTeachers.tsx`

## What Works Now
✅ Page loads without errors
✅ Displays all departments with their teachers
✅ Shows default teachers if no data in localStorage
✅ Loads teachers from localStorage (synced with Supabase)
✅ Handles empty departments gracefully
✅ Only displays fields that have data
✅ Responsive design works correctly

## Data Flow
1. **TeacherManager** (in Principal Dashboard) saves teachers to Supabase
2. **Supabase** syncs to localStorage automatically
3. **OurTeachers** page reads from localStorage
4. Page displays the faculty information

## Testing
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/our-teachers`
2. Page should display without errors
3. Should show all departments with their teachers
4. If a department has no teachers, shows "No teachers in this department yet"
5. Teacher cards display properly with all information

## Note About PayPal Error
The PayPal error in console is unrelated to this page:
```
GET https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID&currency=USD net::ERR_ABORTED 400
```
This is from the payment integration and doesn't affect the faculty page functionality.

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Faculty page now works correctly
✅ No more console errors related to OurTeachers
✅ Page displays properly with all teacher information
✅ Syncs with data from Principal Dashboard's TeacherManager
